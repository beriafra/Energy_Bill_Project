# Energy_Bill_project
The Valley of Shangri-La is experiencing an unprecedented energy crisis due to the recent disruption to gas supplies. As a result, the government launched a public consultation on how to help its residents manage their fuel bills and keep warm as it gets closer to its winter season. The residents of Shangri-La voted overwhelmingly to support the Energy Bills Support Scheme, and the creation of GSE (Great Shangri-La Energy), a publicly-own energy company committed to providing affordable and sustainable energy supplies to Shangri-La.

The Energy Bills Support Scheme and the creation of GSE aim to address the energy crisis and provide affordable energy supplies in the Valley of Shangri-La. The SWOT analysis highlights opportunities and challenges for sustainability. To sustain the project, it is important to collaborate with government agencies and energy companies, regularly evaluate and update strategies and technologies, and effectively address weaknesses. With public support and growth opportunities, the project has potential for a lasting positive impact.

Develop a web interface for an energy tool, iGSE, to provide Shangri-La residents with a platform to submit regular meter readings and view their bills online, and pay the bills using energy vouchers provided by the government. iGSE may be implemented as a Web Application, a Native Android/iOS app, or a Hybrid app. In addition, GSE plans to provide open access to energy consumption data and statistics via its platform. Develop a REST API to allow the general public to search energy consumption data.

Initial thoughts about the project are:

HTML and CSS for the front-end design and implementing Bootstrap as my primary CSS framework. Java Springboot for server-side applications and employing MySQL as database management system.
